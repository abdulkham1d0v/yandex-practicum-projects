# Analyzing Taxi Rides from Airport

### Goal of the project:
The `SQL` part of the project done on on the **Yandex Practicum**'s platform. And here we will be analyze data which we get working by `SQL`.  

Based on this data we must test hypothesis which is given below:

`"The average duration of rides from the Loop to O'Hare International Airport changes on rainy Saturdays."`

### Project plan:
1. **Step 4**. ***Exploratory data analysis***
2. **Step 5**. ***Testing hypotheses***
3. **General Conclusion**

### Used libraries:
1. **Pandas**: used for `data preporecessing`, `data analyzing` and partially `data visualization`.
2. **matplotlib.pyplot**: used as an helper library for visualize `graphs`.
3. **scipy**: used for testing hypotheses.


### Conclusion drawn from the project:
We have made lots of calculatons.We observed that `Flash Cab` company was leading on number of trips on `15-16th November 2017`. And we can prefer partnership on ads top5 companies for next 2 days(We know that in real industry there will be more factors which will affect and only 2 days will not be enough we are concluding according to data which we had). Then we have found **TOP 10** dropoff locations on `November` and here we leading `Loop` neighborhood which we considered in our hypothese and sql task. Also, O'Hare were on top 5 (5th). And let's turn to hypothese we rejected  `null` hypothesis. This means we can not prove or disprove the hypothese is correct or not correct. It seems like `alternative` must be true. Only thing that we can say that we fail to reject or rejected hypotheses.

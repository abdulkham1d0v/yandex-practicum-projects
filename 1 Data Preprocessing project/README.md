# Analyzing borrowers’ risk of defaulting

### Goal of the project:
To prepare a report for a bank’s loan division. Need to find out if a customer’s marital status and number of children has an impact on whether they will default on a loan. The bank already has some data on customers’ credit worthiness.

Report will be considered when building a **credit scoring** of a potential customer. A **credit scoring** is used to evaluate the ability of a potential borrower to repay their loan.

### Used libraries:
1. **Pandas**: used for `data preporecessing`, `data analyzing`.
2. **NLTK**: used for categorizing `purpose` column into *categories*.
3. **Counter**: used for counting most appeared words in `purpose` column

### Conclusion drawn from the project:
Generally, in real world there are more reasons will affect when borrowing loan or credit. But, from the data we have analyzed we can conclude that: `'having kids'`, `'family_status'` and `'purpose'` play important roles on being a `potential borrower`.
And `income_level` has less priority than these 3 purposes.
